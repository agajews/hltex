\section{HLTeX is Awesome}
Here are some words that are in this section.
Math is fun, so here's an equation:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = x^2 + 3
\end{equation}
We might want to give our equation a label, like this:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cubic}
    f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2
\end{equation}
We can reference our equation with Equation \ref{eq:cubic}.
This is automatically joined with the non-breaking space \verb{~}.
