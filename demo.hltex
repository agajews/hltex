\sec{Some Words}
Here are some words that are in this section.
Math is fun, so here's an equation:
\eq:
    f(x) = x^2 + 3
We might want to give our equation a label, like this:
\eq[cubic]:
    f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2
We can reference our equation with Equation \ref{eq:cubic}.
This is automatically joined with the non-breaking space \verb{~}.
